#Covid19Analysis

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and it rose exponentially in Q1 2020.
Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention.

As the cases were rising worldwide, there was a part needed to be contributed by analysts.
So, the data was gathered from all around the world and categorized it according to contries, cities, provinces etc. specifically. Further the data analysis was required to measure the frequency and draw insights, to know and go into granular level of inspection.

Data is been collected from [data.world](https://data.world/), dataset is until April 2020.

Observations drawn out:
1. Covid Cases rose exponentially and which is plotted using a graph.
2. Bar graph is plotted based on ranked top 10 Countries having maximum number of cases.
3. Countries states/provinces are also listed when hovered on any of it's country from bar graph.
4. Data seggregation and statistical analysis is been done on categories.
5. These categories are based on Confirmed cases, Deaths worldwide/country specific.
6. Statistical data is been mapped to Geo-Map that presents Country's name, total cases etc.
7. The encircled area on each of those countries on Map depicts the intensity of cases which is represent using the 'Map Legend'.

Further after completion of visualization and drawing insights, it can be shared to Medical/Health Organizations.
